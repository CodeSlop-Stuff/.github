This group is just for two friends trying to learn more about and push their knowledge on the language of C#, Despite the name, this collecton of programs will NEVER contain AI, as it is a testament to the human ability to learn and grow.

Do not try and add anything to this organisation via pull requests, as it will not be implemented. Issues will be discussed between us however.

Please dont expect any high levels of quality here as it is entirely experimentation between us and comes with no guarantee of functionality.

Potentially one day more languages may be used here for learning but for the time being it is only C#
